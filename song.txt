Outside the cafe by the cracker factory
You were practicing a magic trick
And my thoughts got rude, as you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick and mix

Said, "You're mistaken if you're thinking that I haven't been called "cold" before"
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
Is all you had left and it was going to waste
